# SMD to Through-Hole Breakout Boards for Breadboards and Veroboard

## Overview
This repository contains breakout boards that allow you to use surface mount components (SMD) on breadboards or veroboard. These adapters simplify prototyping with SMD components, making it easier to integrate them into your projects.

## Features
- **0.1" Spaced Male Headers:** Use these headers to connect the breakout boards to your breadboard or veroboard.
- **Testpoints** Each pin has it own dedicated testpoint for easier debugging when using an oscilloscope or multimeter
- **Dedicated VCC and GND Pins** Top row is always VCC and Bottom is GND
- **Decoupling Capacitor** Ability to a decoupling capacitor on board and use a jumper wire to your ICs Vcc pin
- **Output Capacitor** Ability to add output capacitor as well in-even the is Vout Pin. Be sure to cut pad in the middle to decouple the VCCs (see above capacitors)
- **Cost-Effective:** SMD components are generally cheaper than their through-hole counterparts.
- **Fits on Perfboards:** You can also use these breakout boards on perfboards for more permanent projects.

## Usage
1. **Soldering:** Solder your SMD component onto the breakout board, aligning the pads with the corresponding pins.
2. **Connect to Breadboard:** Insert the male headers into the breadboard, ensuring they align with the breakout board's pins.
3. **Wire Up:** Connect other components or wires as needed.
